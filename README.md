# Thermostat

## Motivation

This is the week 5 group collaboration project from Makers Academy.
This project is a thermostat.

## Build status

README created and Jasmine testing framework set up. User stories complete; working on refactoring.

## User Stories

```
As a heating user
So that I can have my home at a reasonable temperature
I would like to have my thermostat start at 20 degrees

As a cold user
So that I can stay warm
I would like to be able to increase the temperature

As a hot user
So that I can stay cool
I would like to be able to decrease the temperature

As a user in a cold country
So that my pipes don’t freeze
I would like the minimum temperature to be 10 degrees

As a money-savvy user
So that my bills don’t get too high
I would like to have a power saving mode that sets the maximum temperature to 25 degrees

As a user that gets cold easily
So that I can upgrade the maximum temperature to 32 degrees
I would like to be able to switch off the power saving mode

As a forgetful user
So that I don’t over-use the heating by mistake
I would like the power saving mode to be on by default

As an efficient user
So that I can save time
I would like to be able to reset the temperature to 20 with a single function
```
